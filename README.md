# Air Quality Trainings ‚Äì Module 2: Ground Measurements with OpenAQ

This repository contains **Module 2** of the Air Quality Trainings series, focusing on the use of **ground-based air quality observations**.  
In this module, we explore how to access, process, and analyze ground measurement data from **[OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/)**, an open platform providing global air quality data.

## üìñ Overview

Air pollution is a critical challenge for environmental health and climate resilience. Reliable **ground measurements** provide the foundation for validation, monitoring, and modeling efforts.  

This module demonstrates:
- Accessing ground air quality data via the **OpenAQ API**.
- Understanding the structure of pollutant observations (e.g., PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ, PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ).
- Basic data cleaning and transformation using Python.
- Visualizing temporal and spatial patterns of air quality.
- Preparing datasets for integration with remote sensing and modeling frameworks.
