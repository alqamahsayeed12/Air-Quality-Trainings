# Air-Quality-Trainings

**These Modules were developed as part of Training in Guatemala for NASA - SERVIR**

This is a collection designed to provide training resources, materials, and code related to air quality. The repository is organized into modules, each addressing different aspects or topics within air quality education and analysis. This modular structure allows for focused learning and development in each branch, supporting both foundational and advanced topics in air quality studies.

## Branches in this Repository

This repository contains the following six branches:

- **main**  
- **Module-1** This notebook provides code to visualize ground monitor data obtained from the EPA using the AirNow API. It allows users to display the locations of ground monitors on a map and visualize pollutant levels, likely related to air quality.
- **Module-2** In this module, we explore how to access, process, and analyze ground measurement data from OpenAQ, an open platform providing global air quality data.
- **Module-3** This notebook performs a comparison of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data obtained from two different sources: the satellite-based VIIRS instrument and the ground-based AERONET network. 
- **Module-4** This notebook analyzes and visualizes atmospheric composition data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4 dataset.
- **Module-5** This notebook compares the PM2.5 data from the EPA and GEOS-FP model for several cities.
